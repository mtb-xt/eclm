# eclm

Some time ago I've found this nice article about how to list ec2 instances from the console:
http://www.heystephenwood.com/2015/02/list-running-ec2-instances-with-golang.html

Unfortunately, the code doesn't work with the recent version of aws-sdk for Golang, so I've decided to try and rewrite it.

P.S. I don't know Go, I don't know how to program so this probably is a very nice example of how not to write Go code :-D

P.P.S. eclm is for 'EC2 List Mega'
